While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the interaction between Expo Go and a custom native module. Specifically, when running the app on an Android device using Expo Go, I would get a runtime error indicating that a specific native module function was not found or could not be invoked correctly. However, the same code worked perfectly when building a standalone APK.
