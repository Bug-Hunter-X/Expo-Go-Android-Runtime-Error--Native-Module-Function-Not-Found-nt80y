The issue likely stems from differences in how Expo Go loads native modules compared to a standalone APK. The solution is to carefully check and ensure the native module is properly configured for Expo Go's runtime environment. This includes double-checking the module's setup in both Android's `MainApplication.java` and your React Native code, and considering alternative approaches to ensure compatibility if needed, like ensuring necessary dependencies are included in the module and react native dependencies. Specific fixes depend on the native module's implementation. In many cases, the problem is resolved by verifying that the native moduleâ€™s methods are correctly exposed through the bridge. If the module utilizes a specific build process, confirm that it correctly handles the Expo Go context.
